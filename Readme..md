I want this program to be able to allow two people to play tic tac toe against eachother.

This project is interesting to me because tic tac toe is a fun game, that I could play with practically anyone

Completed the whole thing. The Tic-Tac-Toe game is finished and ready to player with two players. When the game starts it first checks to see if there is a three in a row. It then gets the first players move assigned as 'x' and places it in the cooridnate that corrispodes with the numbers on the number pad. It then checks for three in a row again and then lets player 2 move assinged as 'o'

I learned from this project as well as every other lab that it is a lot easier if you break the project up into doable parts rather than just trying to write it all out. 
As I was working with my brother-in-law he had me right out a lot of the if statements in the get move method. He then told me that if there is a lot of repeating lines then you can probably write another method to make it cleaner. He then showed me this with the placemove method.
